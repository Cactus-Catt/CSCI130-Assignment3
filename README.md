# CSCI130-Assignment3 for Intro to Scientific Programming
Promt:
Objective: 
•	Work with basic input commands. 
•	Work with decision making commands.
Write a program using C named studentGPA_Surname (e.g. studentGPA_Lynch). The program should perform the following:
•	Ask for the number of credits a student has passed. State whether the student is a freshman (0-23), sophomore (24-59), junior (60-89), or senior (90 or greater).  
•	Ask for a grade point average. Using labels from some table I found, state whether the student’s gpa is “Excellent” (= 4.0), “Very good” (>= 3.75), “Good” (>= 3.2), “Above average” (>= 3.0), “Average” (>= 2.5), “Satisfactory” (>= 2.0), or “Poor” (< 2.0). 
•	Using the inputs from the previous two questions, state whether the student is eligible for graduation. For this question, to be able to graduate the student needs a gpa >= 2.2 and have passed 120 credits. You should not ask for additional inputs here.
